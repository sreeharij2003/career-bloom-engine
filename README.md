# Job Board Web Application

This is a job board web application that displays job listings from various sources through web scraping.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI components
- React Router for navigation
- Tanstack Query for data fetching

## Backend Implementation Guide

The frontend is designed to work with a backend API that provides job listing data. Below is a guide for implementing the backend web scraping solution.

### 1. Target Websites for Scraping

Recommended job sites to scrape:
- Indeed
- LinkedIn
- Glassdoor
- Monster
- ZipRecruiter

### 2. Data Points to Extract

For each job listing, extract:
- Job title
- Company name
- Company logo URL
- Location
- Job type (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, etc.)
- Posting date
- Job description
- Tags/Skills
- Salary information (if available)
- Application URL
- Source website

### 3. Backend Tech Stack Recommendations

#### Option 1: Node.js Backend
- Express.js for API server
- Puppeteer or Cheerio for web scraping
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage
- Node-cron for scheduling

#### Option 2: Python Backend
- FastAPI or Flask for API server
- BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for web scraping
- SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL for data storage
- APScheduler for scheduling

### 4. API Endpoints to Implement

```
GET /api/jobs - Get all jobs with filtering options
GET /api/jobs/search - Search for jobs
GET /api/jobs/:id - Get job details
POST /api/jobs/refresh - Trigger a scraping run
```

### 5. Handling Anti-Scraping Measures

- Implement request throttling and delays between requests
- Rotate user agents and IP addresses (consider using proxy services)
- Handle CAPTCHAs with services like 2Captcha or Anti-Captcha
- Implement session management to mimic human browsing behavior

### 6. Scheduling Scraping Jobs

- Set up daily or weekly scraping jobs
- Implement delta updates (only scrape new listings)
- Run scraping during off-peak hours
- Store job run metadata to track success/failure

### 7. Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  company VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  logo_url TEXT,
  location VARCHAR(255),
  job_type VARCHAR(50),
  posted_date DATE,
  description TEXT,
  salary VARCHAR(100),
  application_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  source VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  unique_identifier VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE job_tags (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  job_id INTEGER REFERENCES jobs(id),
  tag VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

### 8. Example Python Scraping Script

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import time
import random
from datetime import datetime
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

USER_AGENTS = [
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.0 Safari/605.1.15',
    # Add more user agents
]

def scrape_indeed(job_title, location, num_pages=3):
    jobs = []
    
    for page in range(num_pages):
        try:
            url = f"https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q={job_title.replace(' ', '+')}&l={location.replace(' ', '+')}&start={page * 10}"
            headers = {'User-Agent': random.choice(USER_AGENTS)}
            
            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
            if response.status_code != 200:
                logger.error(f"Failed to fetch page {page} from Indeed: {response.status_code}")
                continue
                
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
            job_cards = soup.find_all('div', class_='job_seen_beacon')
            
            for job in job_cards:
                try:
                    title_elem = job.find('h2', class_='jobTitle')
                    title = title_elem.get_text().strip() if title_elem else "Unknown Title"
                    
                    company_elem = job.find('span', class_='companyName')
                    company = company_elem.get_text().strip() if company_elem else "Unknown Company"
                    
                    location_elem = job.find('div', class_='companyLocation')
                    location = location_elem.get_text().strip() if location_elem else "Unknown Location"
                    
                    # Extract more details...
                    
                    # Add to jobs list
                    jobs.append({
                        'title': title,
                        'company': company,
                        'location': location,
                        'source': 'Indeed',
                        'unique_identifier': f"indeed_{title}_{company}".replace(' ', '_').lower(),
                        # Add other extracted fields
                    })
                    
                except Exception as e:
                    logger.error(f"Error parsing job card: {e}")
            
            # Random delay between requests
            time.sleep(random.uniform(3, 7))
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error scraping Indeed page {page}: {e}")
    
    return jobs

# Similar functions for other job sites...

def run_scraping_job():
    logger.info("Starting scraping job")
    job_searches = [
        {"title": "software engineer", "location": "remote"},
        {"title": "data scientist", "location": "new york"},
        # Add more search combinations
    ]
    
    all_jobs = []
    
    for search in job_searches:

        all_jobs.extend(indeed_jobs)
        # all_jobs.extend(linkedin_jobs)
        # all_jobs.extend(glassdoor_jobs)
    
    # Save to database
    save_jobs_to_database(all_jobs)
    
    logger.info(f"Scraping job completed. Found {len(all_jobs)} jobs.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_scraping_job()
```

### 9. Error Handling Recommendations

- Log all scraping errors with timestamps
- Implement automatic retry for failed requests
- Send alerts for persistent failures
- Create a dashboard to monitor scraping job health

### 10. Connecting Frontend to Backend

The frontend code in this repository is already set up to call a backend API. You'll need to:

1. Deploy your backend API service
2. Update the `jobsService.ts` file to point to your actual API endpoints
3. Ensure your API responses match the expected TypeScript interfaces

## Deployment

For a complete solution:

1. Deploy the frontend (this React application) to a service like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify
2. Deploy the backend scraping service to a platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean
3. Set up a database service (MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS, etc.)
4. Configure CORS to allow your frontend to communicate with your backend
5. Set up scheduled jobs for regular scraping

## Legal Considerations

Before deploying a web scraper in production:

1. Review the Terms of Service of the websites you plan to scrape
2. Respect robots.txt files
3. Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading target websites
4. Consider reaching out to job boards about their API options
5. Consult with a legal professional about compliance with applicable laws

## Maintenance

- Regularly check your scraper functionality as websites may change their structure
- Update user agents periodically
- Monitor for changes in anti-scraping measures
- Keep dependencies updated for security
